Sir Robert de Umfraville (c. 1363 – 1437) was a late medieval English knight who took part in the 
later stages of the Hundred Years' War, particularly against Scotland. Much of his career was focused 
on defending the border with Scotland, which had seen near-constant warfare since the late 13th 
century. He both fought there and participated in embassies, negotiating treaties as a diplomat. 
Beginning his career under Richard II, he probably fought at the 1388 Battle of Otterburn with Henry 
"Hotspur" Percy. In 1415, de Umfraville travelled with Henry V to France, where he may have taken part in the Battle of Agincourt. He was famed for his prowess in martial arts, and his successes in the north attracted praise and reward from the kings he served.
